# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates customer segmentation using the **K-Means Clustering algorithm**. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on their demographic and behavioral attributes, such as age, income, and spending score. By understanding these groups, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies to better meet the needs of each segment.
